## icpAnalyzer
Project to detect intracranial pressure through 3D analysis of a implanted device

## About This Project
icpAnalyzer is a BME project for converting x-ray images of a implanted device into a 3-dimensional model. This model will be used to calculate whether the subject has intracranial hypertension.

## Notes
- [ ] Perform image recognition on single x-ray image
- [ ] Create vectors based on image
- [ ] Build 3D model from vectors
- [ ] Determine amount of deformation compared to reference lengths
- [ ] Develop a UI for the app

Built on JetBrains PyCharm 2023.1.
